Welcome to Bluetu Devs! Here, we offer industrially challenging courses designed to enhance your skills. Our inaugural course focuses on mastering C++ and advancing to a developer level in this language. This 100-day challenge entails uploading a daily video for 100 days, while your challenge is to code and learn the provided concept over the next 100 days.

Exciting, isn't it? C++ stands as one of the most popular development languages, applicable across software, web, app, automation, and gaming domains. Throughout these 100 days, Bluetu will guide you through every conceivable concept, providing you with a robust foundation in development. As the backbone of many languages, C++ often lacks comprehensive playlists or tutorials due to its structural programming nature. However, we offer a unique 100-day challenge, complete with free walkthroughs, source code, and mentorship.

### Basic C++ Programming 

**Day-1:** If the marks obtained by a student in five different subjects are input through the keyboard, find out the aggregate marks and percentage marks obtained by the student. Assume that the maximum marks that can be obtained by a student in each subject is 100.

**Day-2:** If a five-digit number is input through the keyboard, write a program to calculate the sum of its digits. (Hint: Use the modulus operator ‘%’) 

**Day-3:** A cashier has currency notes of denominations 10, 50 and 100. If the amount to be withdrawn is input through the keyboard in hundreds, find the total number of currency notes of each denomination the cashier will have to give to the with drawer. 
    
**Day-4:** A library charges a fine for every book returned late. For first 5 days the fine is 50 paise, for 6-10 days fine is one rupee and above 10 days fine is 5 rupees. If you return the book after 30 days your membership will be canceled. Write a program to accept the number of days the member is late to return the book and display the fine or the appropriate message.
    
**Day-5:** If the three sides of a triangle are entered through the keyboard, write a program to check whether the triangle is isosceles, equilateral, scalene or right angled triangle. 
    
**Day-6:** Write a program to print all prime numbers from 1 to provided number. (Hint: Use nested loops, break and continue)
